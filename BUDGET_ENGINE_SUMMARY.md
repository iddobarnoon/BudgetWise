## 💡 Budget Allocation Strategies

### 1. 50/30/20 Rule
```
50% Needs (housing, utilities, groceries, healthcare)
30% Wants (dining, entertainment, shopping)
20% Savings (emergency fund, investments)
```

### 2. 70/20/10 Rule
```
70% Living Expenses
20% Savings
10% Debt Repayment
```

### 3. Aggressive Savings
```
40% Savings (maximize savings rate)
60% Expenses (minimize discretionary)
```

### 4. Debt Payoff Strategy
```
30% Debt Payments (accelerated payoff)
60% Essentials
10% Discretionary (minimal)
```

### 5. Balanced Strategy
```
Proportional based on necessity scores
Applies user preferences
Adjusts to spending patterns
```

### 6. Zero-Based Budgeting
```
Every dollar allocated
Fixed expenses first
Variable expenses second
Remaining → savings
```

### 7. Envelope Method
```
Fixed envelope per category
Once empty, no more spending
Great for controlling discretionary
```

## 🔄 How It Works

### Budget Creation Flow

```
1. User provides income + goals
   ↓
2. Analyze historical spending (last 3 months)
   ↓
3. Get category priorities from Ranking System
   ↓
4. Determine allocation strategy based on goals
   "Save emergency fund" → Aggressive Savings
   "Pay off debt" → Debt Payoff Strategy
   Default → 50/30/20 Rule
   ↓
5. Calculate allocations per category
   - Use historical averages if available
   - Apply default percentages otherwise
   - Apply goal-based multipliers
   ↓
6. Apply user preferences (custom limits/priorities)
   ↓
7. Rebalance if total > income
   ratio = income / total_allocated
   each_allocation *= ratio
   ↓
8. Save to database
   ↓
9. Return BudgetPlan
```

### Goal-Based Adjustments

| Goal Contains | Adjustments |
|---------------|-------------|
| "save", "emergency fund" | Savings ↑ 150%, Entertainment ↓ 70%, Dining ↓ 70% |
| "debt", "pay off" | Debt Payments ↑ 150%, Entertainment ↓ 50%, Travel ↓ 50% |
| "invest" | Savings ↑ 130% |
| "50/30/20" | Apply 50/30/20 rule |
| "70/20/10" | Apply 70/20/10 rule |

---

### Rebalancing Algorithm

```python
# If allocations exceed income
if total_allocated > income:
    ratio = income / total_allocated

    for allocation in allocations:
        allocation.amount *= ratio

    # Now total equals income exactly
```

---

### Purchase Validation Logic

```python
remaining = allocated - spent
fits = purchase_amount <= remaining
percentage = (purchase_amount / allocated) * 100

if not fits:
    overage = purchase_amount - remaining

    # Find surplus categories
    surplus = find_categories_with_surplus()

    # Generate alternatives
    alternatives = [
        "Wait until next month",
        f"Reduce by ${overage}",
        f"Reallocate from {surplus}"
    ]
```

---

## 🔗 Integration Points

### With Ranking System
```python
# Get category priorities
from ranking_system import ranking_service

priorities = await ranking_service.get_priority_order(user_id)

# Use in budget allocation
sorted_categories = sorted(categories, key=lambda c: priorities[c.id])
```

### With AI Layer
```python
# AI checks budget before recommendation
from budget_engine import budget_engine

result = await budget_engine.check_purchase(
    user_id, amount, category_id, month
)

if result["fits_budget"]:
    return "Go ahead, this fits your budget!"
else:
    return f"Warning: {result['warning']}. {result['alternative_options'][0]}"
```

### With Expense Tracking
```python
# Update budget when expense logged
await budget_engine.update_spent_amount(
    user_id=expense.user_id,
    category_id=expense.category_id,
    amount=expense.amount,
    month=current_month
)
```

## 🚀 Running the Service

# Start budget engine
cd src/backend/components/budget-engine
python3 app.py

# Or with uvicorn
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8003 --reload

# Run tests
python3 test_budget.py
