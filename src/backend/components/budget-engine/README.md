## Budget Allocation Strategies

### 1. 50/30/20 Rule (Default)
- **50% Needs**: Housing, utilities, groceries, healthcare, transportation
- **30% Wants**: Dining, entertainment, shopping, hobbies
- **20% Savings**: Savings accounts, investments, emergency fund

### 2. 70/20/10 Rule
- **70% Living Expenses**: All regular expenses
- **20% Savings**: Future planning
- **10% Debt Repayment**: Pay off debt faster

### 3. Aggressive Savings
- **40% Savings**: Maximize savings rate
- **60% Expenses**: Minimized discretionary spending
- Best for: Building emergency fund, early retirement

### 4. Debt Payoff Strategy
- **30% Debt Payments**: Accelerated debt repayment
- **60% Essentials**: Maintain necessities
- **10% Discretionary**: Minimal wants
- Best for: Getting out of debt quickly

### 5. Balanced Strategy
- Proportional allocation based on necessity scores
- Considers user preferences
- Adjusts to spending patterns

### 6. Zero-Based Budgeting
- Every dollar has a job
- Fixed expenses first, then variable
- No money unallocated

### 7. Envelope Method
- Fixed amount per category
- Once envelope is empty, no more spending
- Great for controlling discretionary spending

## How Budget Creation Works

```python
1. Analyze Historical Spending
   â†“
2. Get Category Priorities (from Ranking System)
   â†“
3. Determine Strategy Based on Goals
   â†“
4. Calculate Allocations
   â†“
5. Apply User Preferences
   â†“
6. Rebalance to Fit Income
   â†“
7. Save to Database
```

## Goal-Based Adjustments

The engine automatically adjusts allocations based on goals:

| Goal | Adjustments |
|------|-------------|
| "Save for emergency fund" | Savings â†‘ 150%, Entertainment â†“ 70% |
| "Pay off debt" | Debt payments â†‘ 150%, Discretionary â†“ 50% |
| "Invest more" | Savings â†‘ 130% |

## Integration with Other Services

### With Ranking System
```python
# Get category priorities for budget allocation
priorities = await ranking_service.get_priority_order(user_id)

# Budget engine uses these priorities
budget = await budget_engine.create_budget(user_id, month, income)
```

### With AI Layer
```python
# AI asks budget engine before recommendations
purchase_check = await budget_engine.check_purchase(
    user_id, amount, category_id, month
)

if not purchase_check["fits_budget"]:
    ai_response = "This doesn't fit your budget. " + purchase_check["warning"]
```

### With Expense Tracking
```python
# When expense is logged, update budget
await budget_engine.update_spent_amount(
    user_id, category_id, amount, month
)
```

## Database Tables Used

- `budgets`: Monthly budget records
- `budget_allocations`: Category-wise allocations
- `expenses`: Historical spending for pattern analysis
- `user_category_preferences`: Custom priorities

## Example Flow: Creating a Budget

```bash
# 1. User provides income and goals
POST /budget/create
{
  "user_id": "user_123",
  "month": "2025-10",
  "income": 5000,
  "goals": ["Save 20% for emergency fund"]
}

# 2. Engine analyzes historical spending
# 3. Selects aggressive savings strategy
# 4. Calculates allocations:
#    - Savings: $2000 (40%)
#    - Housing: $1500 (30%)
#    - Groceries: $750 (15%)
#    - Transportation: $500 (10%)
#    - Entertainment: $250 (5%)

# 5. Returns budget plan
```

## Key Algorithms

### Rebalancing Algorithm
```python
if total_allocated > income:
    ratio = income / total_allocated
    for allocation in allocations:
        allocation.amount *= ratio
```

### Purchase Validation
```python
remaining = allocated - spent
fits = purchase_amount <= remaining
percentage = (purchase_amount / allocated) * 100
```

### Reallocation Detection
```python
overspent = [cat for cat in categories if spent > allocated]
underspent = [cat for cat in categories if remaining > allocated * 0.5]

# Suggest moving funds from underspent to overspent
```

## Performance Considerations

- Categories and rules cached in memory
- Historical analysis limited to last 3 months (200 expenses)
- Allocation calculations use Decimal for precision
- Database queries optimized with proper indexes

## Error Handling

- Returns 404 if budget not found for month
- Returns 400 for invalid amounts (negative, zero)
- Returns 500 for database errors
- Provides user-friendly error messages
